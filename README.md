Sebastian is completely deaf.
Last month, we lost his best friend and a loving part of our family, Phreddy.

What we didn't realize at the time was how much he had depended on her for his hearing. Without her around to "cue" off of, he has really been lost. As I watched him deal with the depression associated with loss, I became acutely aware that he had also lost a different part of himself.

This project is an attempt to help get Sebastian some ears...
